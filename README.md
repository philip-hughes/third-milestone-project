# Third milestone project — "Doc docs - clinic appointment scheduler"

This project website is an appointment scheduling application designed for use in general practitioner's clinic.  The primary purpose of the
application is to allow the clinic administrators to schedule appointments for the various doctors who work in the clinic, and to allow 
the doctors to view their appointments.  

The site comprises 2 web pages, is fully responsive and can be viewed in desktop, tablet and mobile devices. The calendar screen in the desktop
and tablet views will show the appointments table and datepicker by default. However in the mobile view, the datepicker is hidden by default and can be viewed
clicking on the calendar icon button, which is only displayed in mobile view.

Appointments can also be edited or removed via the Appointment details modal which will be displayed if an existing appointment slot is clicked.

The project is running at: http://doctor-docs.herokuapp.com/

## UX

The purpose of this site is to enable a clinic administrator to schedule or remove an appointment for the selected doctor, and to allow the doctor
to view those same appointments.

At the beginning of the project I listed the features that were a must for the site, and features that were nice to have. The core features
I wanted were
 1. Option to add and remove appointments for a particular doctor
 2. Option to easily switch the selected doctor
 3. A datepicker to select the date for which appointments are made and displayed.

I had also considered adding options to add a new patient or doctor, but due to time constraints and the fact that
the project requirements of create, read, update and delete were already met, I decided to leave them out and spend
time on implementing the sidebar toggle feature instead.

After deciding on the main project features I agreed with my mentor that the general layout, appointment flow and modals should be similar to the google
calendar web application, which has a fairly standard appointment scheduling flow and would be familiar to a lot of
users, thus making my application more intuitive. 

We then decided on the DB structure which comprises the following collections
1. The doctor collection: This contains two string fields - 'name' and 'profile_picture'.
2. The patients collection: This contains one string field = 'name'
3. The appointments collection: This contains four string fields - 'doctor_id', 'patient_id', 'first_slot' and 'last_slot'.
4. The days collection: This contains a string field - 'date', and an array of 'appointment_ids'

After agreeing on the features, layout and DB structure I created the project wire frames which can be found in root directory of the project repository.


## Features

### Existing Features — Entry screen
- **Bootstrap grid of doctor profile cards** - Bootstrap grid layout is used here to display the doctor cards.  The number of cards displayed per row will adjust
    depending on the screenwidth.  Card size will remain the same however.
### Existing Features — Calendar screen
- **Doctor avatar** - An avatar displaying an image of the currently selected doctor with the doctor name
- **Select doctor dropdown** - A dropdown input that displays the currently selected doctor as the first option.
- **Datepicker** - A flatpickr datepicker which is used to change the date for which appointments can be made and are displayed.
- **Appointments table** - A table of appointment slots.  Each hour has four slots of 15minutes. However, appointments are not limited to
    one 15minute slot.
- **New appointment modal** - A modal that is displayed when an empty slot is clicked. Modal displays doctor name, date, start time, and there 
     select dropdowns to choose the end time and patient name.  The Add appointment is used to submit the form.    
- **Edit appointment modal** - A modal that is displayed when clicking on an existing appointment. Modal displays doctor name, date, start time, and there 
     select dropdowns to choose the end time and patient name.  The currently end time and patient name are displayed initially but can be changed. Changes
     are submitted using the Update Appointment button. The appointment can be removed using the Delete button.    
### Existing Features — Calendar screen mobile view
- **Calendar button and sidebar** - In screens below 799px, the datepicker is hidden and calendar toggle button is displayed which allows users to open the
    datepicker sidebar. When clicked the datepicker will be displayed, and an overlay is displayed over the rest of the page content.  

## Technologies Used

— [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
 — Bootstrap was used for the site layout and the datepicker sidebar.

— [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
 — Jquery is used throughout the project in conjunction with plain javascript for writing to the DOM and local
   storage.

— [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
 — Font Awesome icons were used for the calendar toggle button, and for the modal form fields.

— [Flatpickr](https://flatpickr.js.org/)
 — The datepicker is from the free and open source Flatpickr library.

— [Select2](https://select2.org)
 — I used the Select2 libraries for the patient dropdown so as you can search the list by typing the
   name of the patient.

### Content
— The doctor profile images were found through a google image search and are hosted locally.

### Acknowledgments

— The box shadow CSS used for the doctor cards on the entry page was taken from an example on the w3schools site. I liked
 the way it looked, and didn't see any reason to change it, so I left it as is.
